I realised that the Binary Search Tree works basically by being divided into left subtree and the right subtree. So, for every method, I compared my required result in the right and left subtrees and resultantly found my desired result. Also, recursion have played a major role since the continuous division of trees and to keep hold of them was difficult, therefore recursion made the life easily for me.
